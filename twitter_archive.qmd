## Keeping up with the R community

### There are many sources

-   newsletters

-   mastodon?

-   Meetups

## Twitter has been important

The #rstats hashtag opens a world. Useful to follow specific individuals and the people they follow.

Grabbing content can be a challenge. My process has been:

-   Save Web pages that are referenced in Evernote with its web clipper plugin

-   Save images

-   Selective "likes"

### Getting the Twitter Archive

Here are instructions for downloading your archive from Twitter

### Use the built-in html interface

### Using R to access the data from your Twitter Archive

Demonstration, looking at how to access and possible uses of `like.js` and `following.js`.

```{r}
#| label: libraries and such
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(jsonlite)
library(gt)
```

```{r}
#| label: read the files

following <- read_file(here("data", "following.js")) |>
  str_sub(start = 30) |> 
  fromJSON()

like <- read_file(here("data", "like.js")) |>
  str_sub(start = 25) |> 
  fromJSON()


```

```{r}
following_df <- as_tibble(flatten(following$following))
like_df <- as_tibble(flatten(like$like))

```

```{r}
like_df[1:100,2:3] |> 
  filter(str_detect(fullText,"http")) |> 
  gt()
```
