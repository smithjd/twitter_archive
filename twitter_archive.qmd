## Keeping up with the R community

### There are many sources

-   newsletters

-   mastodon?

-   Meetups

## Twitter has been important

The #rstats hashtag opens a world. Useful to follow specific individuals and the people they follow.

Grabbing content can be a challenge. My process has been:

-   Save Web pages that are referenced in Evernote using its handy web clipper plugin
-   Save images to my photo library and take it from there
-   Selective "likes"
-   Extract relevant text with an OCR browser extension https://github.com/amebalabs/TRex 

### Getting the Twitter Archive

Request a download here: https://twitter.com/settings/download_your_data 

It can take a few days for it to be ready.  You'll get a direct message on Twitter when it's ready to download.

### Use the built-in html interface

### Using R to access the data from your Twitter Archive

Demonstration, looking at how to access and possible uses of `like.js` and `following.js`.

```{r}
#| label: libraries and such
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(jsonlite)
library(gt)
```

```{r}
#| label: read the files

following <- read_file(here("data", "following.js")) |>
  str_sub(start = 30) |> 
  fromJSON()

str(following[[1]])

like <- read_file(here("data", "like.js")) |>
  str_sub(start = 25) |> 
  fromJSON()

str(like[[1]])
```

```{r}
following_df <- as_tibble(flatten(following$following))
glimpse(following_df)

like_df <- as_tibble(flatten(like$like))
glimpse(like_df)
```

```{r}
gt_table <- like_df[1:100,2:3] |> 
  filter(str_detect(fullText,"http")) |> 
  gt() 
  gtsave(gt_table, "gt_table.html")
  
gt_table
```
